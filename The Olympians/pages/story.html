      <h2>The Story of The Olympians</h2>
      <p>
        In the beginning, there was chaos. From this chaos, the Titans were
        born. They were powerful beings who ruled over the universe and had
        overthrown their father, Uranus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, one of Uranus's sons, Cronus, overthrew his father by
        castrating him with his scythe and hence became the ruler of the Titans.
        He then married his sister Rhea and together they birthed many children
        who would later become the famous Olympians.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But, Cronus was a paranoid and power-hungry ruler who feared that his
        children would overthrow him, just as he had overthrown his own father.
        So, as each of his children was born, he swallowed them whole to prevent
        them from ever challenging his authority.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, when Zeus was born, Rhea tricked Cronus by giving him a rock to
        swallow instead. She then sent Zeus to be raised in secret on the island
        of Crete.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As Zeus grew older, he began to understand his destiny: to overthrow
        Cronus and the Titans and take his rightful place as the ruler of the
        universe. With the help of mythical beasts like the Cyclops and the
        Hecatonchires, Zeus led a ten-year war against the Titans.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        During the war, Zeus forced Kronos to regurgitate his siblings Poseidon,
        Hades, Demeter, and Hera who were still alive and unharmed. They then
        fought alongside Zeus against the Titans, leading to their eventual
        defeat and imprisonment in Tartarus (The Underworld.)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        With the Titans defeated, Zeus and his siblings were able to claim their
        place as the new rulers of the universe. Zeus became the king of the
        gods, Poseidon was given dominion over the sea, and Hades was given
        control over the underworld.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, the transition of power was not without its challenges. The
        gods had to deal with rebellious mortals, jealous rivals, and their own
        family dramas. Hera, Zeus's wife, was known for her jealousy and would
        often take revenge on Zeus's many love affairs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Despite these challenges, the Olympians ruled for many years and were
        worshipped by the ancient Greeks. Their stories have inspired countless
        works of art, literature, and entertainment, and they continue to
        captivate people's imaginations today.
