          Artemis is revered as the goddess of the hunt, wilderness, childbirth,
          and virginity. She's often depicted as a young and beautiful woman,
          carrying a bow and arrow and wearing a short tunic and sturdy hunting
          boots.

          According to legend, Artemis was born as the twin sister of Apollo,
          after their mother Leto was banished from Mount Olympus. She's
          associated with the moon and is often depicted with a crescent moon on
          her forehead, symbolizing her connection to the night and the wild.

          Artemis is a fiercely independent and strong-willed goddess, who
          values her freedom and autonomy above all else. She's often called
          upon to protect young women and children, and is known for her
          compassion and generosity towards those in need.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Artemis is also a fearsome hunter and defender of the wild. As a
          hunter, Artemis is believed to have only hunted what she needed and to
          have respected the animals she killed. She was known for her skill
          with a bow and arrow and was often depicted with a hunting dog or deer
          by her side. She's often portrayed as a solitary figure, wandering
          through the forests and mountains in search of prey and adventure.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In some myths, Artemis is said to have shot, using her arrows, hunters
          who were disrespectful or wasteful with the animals they killed
          causing them a slow and painful death.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Artemis is a complex and dynamic goddess, embodying the virtues of
          independence, strength, compassion, and fierce protectiveness.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Artemis's Roman name is Diana.</p>
