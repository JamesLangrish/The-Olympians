          Hephaestus is the Greek god of blacksmiths, metalworking, and
          craftsmanship. He is depicted as a muscular, bearded man who wields a
          hammer and wears an apron. Born as the son of Zeus and Hera, he was
          literally thrown out of Mount Olympus as a baby due to his physical
          deformity. He was raised by the people of the island of Lemnos and
          became a master craftsman.

          compassionate, willing to help those in need and to use his talents
          for the greater good.

          symbol of human perseverance and resilience. He embodies the virtues
          of creativity, ingenuity, perseverance, and compassion.
