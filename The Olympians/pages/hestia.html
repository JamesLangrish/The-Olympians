          Hestia is revered as the goddess of the hearth, home, and family.
          She's often depicted as a modest and reserved woman, wearing a simple
          gown and carrying a kettle or a torch.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          According to legend, Hestia was one of the original twelve Olympian
          gods and goddesses, and gave up her seat to Dionysus so she could tend
          to the sacred hearth of the gods. She's associated with the hearth and
          the sacred fire, and is often called upon to bless homes and ensure
          their warmth and security.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hestia is known for her calm and gentle nature, and is often portrayed
          as a peaceful and nurturing figure, who provides comfort and stability
          to her worshippers. She's respected by mortals and gods alike for her
          purity and devotion, and is often invoked in prayers and rituals to
          bring harmony and balance to the home and the community.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But Hestia is not just a domestic goddess - she's also a powerful and
          independent figure, who values her autonomy and freedom above all
          else. She's often portrayed as a solitary figure, dwelling in her own
          domain, and refusing to take part in the conflicts and intrigues of
          the other gods and goddesses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hestia embodies the virtues of purity, devotion, nurturing, and
          independence. She provides a sense of warmth and security to the home
          and the community, and is revered for her calming and stabilizing
          influence.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Hestia's Roman name is Vesta.</p>
