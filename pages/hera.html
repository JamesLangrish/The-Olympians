          Hera is revered as the goddess of marriage, family, and childbirth.
          She's often depicted as a regal and imposing woman, wearing a crown
          and carrying a scepter or a lotus-tipped staff.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          According to legend, Hera was born as the daughter of the Titans
          Cronus and Rhea, and later became the queen of the gods after marrying
          her brother Zeus. She's associated with the peacock and is often
          depicted with one by her side, symbolizing her beauty and power.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hera is a proud and formidable goddess, who values loyalty,
          commitment, and tradition above all else. She's often called upon to
          bless marriages and protect families, and is known for her fierce
          protectiveness towards children and mothers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But Hera is not just a domestic goddess - she's also a powerful and
          cunning politician, who's not afraid to use her wits and influence to
          get what she wants. She's often portrayed as a formidable opponent to
          Zeus, and is known for her intense jealousy and vindictiveness towards
          his many affairs which have been the subject of many Greek myths and
          legends.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Hera embodies the virtues of loyalty, commitment, tradition, and
          political savvy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Hera's Roman name is Juno.</p>
