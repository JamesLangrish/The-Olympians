          Hades is known for his role as the ruler of the underworld. He is the
          eldest son of Cronus and Rhea, and was swallowed by his father along
          with his siblings. When Zeus overthrew Cronus, Hades and his brothers
          drew lots to divide the world among themselves, with Hades receiving
          the underworld.

          Hades is often depicted as a somber and intimidating figure, dressed
          in dark robes and holding a staff. He is also sometimes shown wearing
          a helmet that makes him invisible, which he uses to move about
          undetected in the mortal world. Despite his fearsome reputation, Hades
          is not an evil god, but rather a stern and just one.

          Hades' realm, the underworld, is the final resting place for the souls
          of the dead. Those who led good lives are sent to the Elysian Fields,
          a paradise reserved for heroes and the virtuous, while those who led
          wicked lives are punished in Tartarus. Hades is responsible for
          judging the souls and ensuring that the balance between life and death
          is maintained.

          Hades is married to Persephone, daughter of Demeter. According to
          mythology, Hades abducted Persephone and made her his queen of the
          underworld. This event is said to have caused Demeter to go into
          mourning, resulting in the changing of the seasons. Hades and
          Persephone have a complicated relationship, but they are also a symbol
          of the cyclical nature of life and death.

          Hades may be one of the more feared gods of Greek mythology, but he
          plays an important role in maintaining order and balance in the
          universe.
