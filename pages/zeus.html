          Zeus is one of the most famous figures in Greek mythology, revered as
          the king of the gods and the god of lightning and thunder. He's often
          depicted as a powerful and regal figure, with a beard and a
          thunderbolt in his hand.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          According to legend, Zeus was born as the son of the Titans Cronus and
          Rhea, and overthrew his father to become the ruler of the gods. He's
          associated with the sky and the natural forces of the world, and is
          often called upon to bring rain, lightning, and other forms of
          elemental power.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Zeus is known for his strength and power, but also for his cunning and
          his ability to shape-shift into different forms. He's also a notorious
          womanizer known for his many affairs with mortal and divine women,
          which often lead to conflicts and dramas among the gods and goddesses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But Zeus is also a wise and just ruler, who values order and justice
          above all else. He's often called upon to arbitrate disputes among the
          gods and to protect the mortals who worship him. He's also known for
          his hospitality and generosity towards those who show him respect and
          honor.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Zeus embodies the virtues of strength, power, wisdom, justice, and
          hospitality. He's a dominant figure in the pantheon of gods and is
          revered as a symbol of authority and power.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Zeus's Roman name is Jupiter.</p>
