          But Athena is not just a warrior goddess - she's also a skilled
          craftswoman and inventor, credited with inventing the plow, the
          trumpet, and the olive tree. She's associated with the city of Athens
          and is often depicted in art and literature as a powerful defender of
          the city and its people.

          the virtues of wisdom, strategy, courage, and creativity.
