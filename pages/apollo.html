          Apollo is the Greek god of music, poetry, prophecy, and healing. He's
          often depicted as a handsome and athletic figure, with long hair and a
          laurel wreath around his head and usually holding his trusty Lyre.

          According to legend, Apollo was born as the son of Zeus and Leto and
          is the twin brother of Artemis. He's associated with music and
          creativity, and is often called upon to inspire artists, musicians,
          and poets.

          Apollo is known for his divine gift of prophecy, and is revered as the
          god of knowledge and wisdom. He's also associated with healing and
          medicine, and is often invoked to bring health and well-being to those
          who worship him.

          But Apollo is not just a god of music, prophecy, and healing - he's
          also a god of the sun and light. He's associated with the warmth and
          radiance of the sun, and is often called upon to bring light and joy
          to people's lives.

          He's a powerful symbol of the human desire for beauty and inspiration,
          as well as the human capacity for wisdom and enlightenment.
